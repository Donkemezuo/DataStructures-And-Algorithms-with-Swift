# Complexicity 
/// - Complexity = is the amount of time and space (memory) needed to perform an algorithm 
/*
- There are different types of Time complexities 
- Constant Time (O(1)) = A constant time algorithm is an algorithm that has the same time complexicity regardless of the size of the data the algorithm is working with 
- Example of constant time operation, accessing a specific element in an array using it's index directly without iterating through the entire list 
- Linear Time(O(N)) = A linear time complexicity is when the time needed to execute an algorithm depends directly on the size of the data. i.e the time increases as the data increases 
- Example: Iterating through a list of items in an array and accessing each element. 
- Quadratic Time(O(N^2)) = A quadratic time complexity happens in nested loops. Where the time it takes to complete the algorithm is the size of the data squared. 
- Logarithmetic Time = A logarithmetic time complexity for algorithms that depends on only a fraction of the data size

# Linked List 
/// - A linked list is a linear data structured which contains different elements.
/// - Elements in a linked list are called nodes and are connected to each other through a reference 
// Characteristics of a Linked List 
    - The first node in a linked list is called the head. 
    - The head node have not parent node
    - The last node in a linked list is called the tail 
    - The tail node have not child node
